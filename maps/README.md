Scraped from [Shelter Associates NGO](http://shelter-associates.org/) website, later some corrections manually done by Nikhil VJ where an area Kothrud region was erroneously in the wrong ward. Visually verified by comparing with official wards PDF on official PMC website, punecorporation.org (original link expired since change of wards in 2017). Metadata contains elected corporator and party information, compiled and shared by [CEE](http://www.ceeindia.org/) [Pune](https://ourpuneourbudget.in). References:
